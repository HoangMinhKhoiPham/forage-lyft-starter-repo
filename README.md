# Lyft Virtual Internship

Welcome to the Lyft Virtual Internship! This repository contains solutions to the tasks provided as part of the internship, showcasing your skills in software architecture, refactoring, testing, and test-driven development.

## Task 1: Reorganized Architecture

### Overview
Draft a UML class diagram representing a new reorganized architecture for the Lyft system. The design should prioritize extensibility and easy maintenance.

### To-do
- Review the current system and identify areas for improvement.
- Design a new architecture allowing for easy addition of new service criteria and flexible car model configurations.
- Draft a UML class diagram reflecting the proposed architecture.

## Task 2: Code Refactor

### Overview
Refactor the existing codebase to align with the new system architecture designed in Task 1. Focus on implementing design patterns such as the strategy and factory patterns.

### To-do
- Analyze the provided class diagram and understand how each class fits together.
- Rewrite the codebase to reflect the new design, ensuring justification for each design decision.
- Utilize strategy and factory patterns where appropriate.

## Task 3: Unit Testing

### Overview
Add unit tests to the codebase to ensure reliability and maintainability. Focus on testing concrete implementations of the engine and battery classes.

### To-do
- Replace the old test suite with new unit tests.
- Test concrete implementations of the engine and battery classes.
- Refine the codebase based on test results to ensure functionality and reliability.

## Task 4: Test-Driven Development

### Overview
Practice test-driven development by adding new functionality to the existing codebase. This involves upgrading Spindler batteries and adding tire servicing criteria.

### To-do
- Use a test-driven development workflow to add new functionality.
- Upgrade Spindler batteries to require service after three years instead of two.
- Implement tire servicing criteria for Carrigan and Octoprime tires based on tire wear sensor data.

## Conclusion
This repository showcases solutions to the tasks provided in the Lyft Virtual Internship. Each task demonstrates skills in software architecture, refactoring, testing, and test-driven development. The solutions aim to improve the maintainability, extensibility, and reliability of the Lyft system.

Estimated time for task completion: 1 hour depending on your learning style.
